# Flash Quizzes

This project holds quizzes for the [Flash](https://github.com/caillouc/flash) app. Any quiz here can be later fetched by the app. Every modification is more than welcome!

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `quizzesList.json` - References all available quizzes
- `quizzes/` - Folder containing JSON files for each quiz content
- `images/` - Folder holding all images required by quizzes, organized in subfolders per quiz

## Main Quiz List File (`quizzesList.json`)

The main quiz list file must be a JSON object with the following structure:

### Required Fields
- **`version`** *(string)*: Version of the quiz list
- **`quizzes`** *(array)*: List of all available quizzes

### Quiz Definition

Each quiz in the `quizzes` array must contain:

#### Required Fields
- **`name`** *(string)*: Display name of the quiz
- **`file_name`** *(string)*: Filename of the corresponding quiz file in the `quizzes/` folder
- **`version`** *(string)*: Version of the quiz (must increment upon any modification)

#### Optional Fields
- **`icon`** *(string)*: Hex value of the desired Flutter icon (find values at [Flutter Icons](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Icons-class.html))
- **`tags`** *(array of strings)*: List of all tags used in the quiz cards
- **`image_folder`** *(string)*: Name of the subfolder within `images/` that contains all images for this quiz

### Example Quiz List
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "quizzes": [
    {
      "name": "World Capitals",
      "file_name": "country-to-capital.json",
      "version": "1.1",
      "icon": "0xe67c",
      "tags": ["Europe", "Asia", "Americas", "Africa", "Oceania"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Mathematical Formulas",
      "file_name": "math-formulas.json",
      "image_folder": "math-images",
      "version": "1.1",
      "icon": "0xf04cd"
    },
    {
      "name": "Greek Alphabet",
      "file_name": "alphabet-grec.json",
      "version": "1.0",
      "icon": "0xe3dd",
      "tags": ["Lowercase", "Uppercase"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Individual Quiz Files

Each quiz file in the `quizzes/` folder must be a JSON array where each element represents a flashcard question.

### Card Definition

Each card is a JSON object that can contain:

#### Required Fields
- **`id`** *(string)*: Unique identifier for the card within the entire quiz file

#### Optional Fields - Front Face
- **`frontTitle`** *(string)*: Title text for the front of the card
- **`frontDescription`** *(string)*: Description text for the front of the card
- **`frontImage`** *(string)*: Image filename for the front of the card (relative to `images/<image_folder>/`)

#### Optional Fields - Back Face
- **`backTitle`** *(string)*: Title text for the back of the card
- **`backDescription`** *(string)*: Description text for the back of the card
- **`backImage`** *(string)*: Image filename for the back of the card (relative to `images/<image_folder>/`)

#### Optional Fields - General
- **`tags`** *(array of strings)*: Tags that categorize this card

### Important Constraints
- At least one front or back field must be specified, otherwise the card will be empty in the application
- The `id` field must be unique across the entire quiz file
- Image files referenced in `frontImage` or `backImage` must exist in the `images/<image_folder>/` directory
- If a quiz uses images, the `image_folder` field must be specified in the quiz definition in `quizzesList.json`

### Example Quiz File
```json
[
  {
    "frontTitle": "France",
    "backTitle": "Paris",
    "tags": ["Europe"],
    "id": "0001"
  },
  {
    "frontTitle": "α",
    "backTitle": "ἂλφα – a",
    "frontDescription": "First letter of Greek alphabet",
    "tags": ["Lowercase", "Greek"],
    "id": "0002"
  },
  {
    "frontTitle": "Pythagorean Theorem",
    "frontImage": "pythagorean_formula.png",
    "backTitle": "a² + b² = c²",
    "backDescription": "Used to find the length of the hypotenuse in a right triangle",
    "tags": ["Mathematics", "Geometry"],
    "id": "0003"
  }
]
```

## Images Organization

When a quiz contains images, they should be organized as follows:

```
images/
├── math-images/
│   ├── pythagorean_formula.png
│   ├── quadratic_formula.png
│   ├── euler_identity.png
│   └── ...
├── chemistry-images/
│   ├── water_molecule.png
│   ├── benzene_ring.png
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Each quiz that uses images should have its own subfolder within the `images/` directory, and the `image_folder` field in the quiz definition should specify this subfolder name.

## Validation

Before submitting any changes, please run the validation script to ensure all requirements are met:

```bash
python3 validate_quizzes.py
```

> **Note:** The `validate_quizzes.py` script was generated by Claude and has not been reviewed by the repository maintainer. The decision not to review it was made to save time, given that the impact of any potential issues is minimal (the script only performs validation checks and doesn't modify files). Use at your own discretion.

The validation script checks:
- ✅ JSON syntax validity for all files
- ✅ Required fields in `quizzesList.json` and quiz files
- ✅ Unique quiz names, file names, and card IDs
- ✅ Correct data types for all fields
- ✅ Image file existence when referenced
- ✅ Consistency between quiz tags and card tags
- ⚠️ Empty cards or unused tags (warnings)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! When adding or modifying quizzes:

1. Update the quiz version in `quizzesList.json` when making changes
2. Ensure all `id` fields are unique within each quiz file
3. If using images, create a dedicated subfolder in `images/` and specify it in the `image_folder` field
4. Place any required images in the appropriate `images/<quiz_subfolder>/` directory
5. Test your JSON files for valid syntax
6. Update tags in both the quiz list and individual cards as needed
7. **Run `python3 validate_quizzes.py` to validate all changes before submitting**
